# RamanID
 RamanID (created by C. Devitre - https://github.com/cljdevitre/raman-peak-id) is designed to ID Raman spectra by comparing with spectral databases. Currently only works with RRUFF. Please mention my Github when using Raman peak ID!
 It is built to use with Jupyter notebooks at present. I am not responsible for any conclusions drawn from peak matching. Users should use caution and common sense when trying to ID spectra. RamanID may wrong, I am not responsible for the accuracy of the results.
